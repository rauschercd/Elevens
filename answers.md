1) You could use the 5 and the 6, or use the other 5 with the 6 and that is it.

2) Yes, they must be J, Q, and K because there is an even number of numbered cards, and because playing the game requires you to get rid of cards pairs at a time(unless theyre J, Q, or K), there will always be an even number of aces and numbered cards, meaning that there can never be 3 cards that aren't J,Q,K.

3) No it doesnt matter because no matter what certain cards can only go with other specific cards. So 7s must go with 4s, 8s must go with 3s, and so on. Therefore it wouldnt matter if a 5/6 pair was played before a 9/2 pair or vice versa.
